# Web App with PKL Model, React Frontend, and Flask Backend

## Overview
This is a web application that utilizes a trained `.pkl` machine learning model, a React JSX frontend, and a Flask backend. The application allows users to interact with the ML model via the web interface.

## Features
- Machine learning model loaded from a `.pkl` file
- Flask backend for API communication
- React JSX frontend for user interaction
- API endpoints for processing user input and returning results
- Interactive UI with real-time feedback

## Models
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (JSX)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning:** `.pkl` model (trained in Python)

## API Endpoints
### `POST /predict`
